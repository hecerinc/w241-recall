## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(data.table)
library(stargazer)
library(tidyverse)

d <- data.table(x)
colnames(d)
d$index <- row.names(d)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#count of respondents
respondent_cnt <- setorder(d[ , count := .N, by = .(age =age.demographic, treatment)])
respondent_cnt 

#plot grouped bar charts

ggplot(respondent_cnt, aes(fill=treatment, y=count, x=age.demographic, color=treatment)) + 
    labs ( title = "Respondent Count by Age Group and Treatment",
             x = "age group")+ 
    geom_bar(position="dodge", alpha = 0.6, stat="identity")

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#mean scores by age group: pre-post
scores_age <- setorder(d[ ,.(mean_score1 = mean(q12.score), mean_score2=mean(q25.score)), by = (age.demographic)])
scores_age
```
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
install.packages("cobalt")
library("cobalt")

install.packages("vtable")
library(vtable)

#covariate balance summary
sumtable(d, group = "treatment", group.test = TRUE)

differences <- d %>%
  group_by(treatment, age.demographic) %>%
  summarise(mean(q12.score, na.rm = TRUE))
```
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

scores_treatment <- d[ ,.(pre_treat_scores = mean(q12.score), post_treat_scores=mean(q25.score)), by = (treatment)]

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
